As a small feature request, we've been asked by the product team to
change the "empty text" when we don't have any todo list items. They
would like to transition it to the following:

> You have no todo items yet! Add one above!

Pretty simple, right? Let's make the change.

## Updating our Source Code

1. In the `~/app/src/static/app.js` file, update line 56 to use the new empty text. ([Editing files in PWD tips here](/pwd-tips#editing-files))

    ```diff
    -                <p className="text-center">No items yet! Add one above!</p>
    +                <p className="text-center">You have no todo items yet! Add one above!</p>
    ```

1. Let's build our updated version of the image, using the same command we used before.

    ```bash
    docker build -t docker-101 .
    ```

1. Let's start a new container using the updated code.

    ```bash
    docker run -dp 3000:3000 docker-101
    ```

**Uh oh!** You probably saw an error like this (the IDs will be different):

```bash
docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint laughing_burnell 
(bb242b2ca4d67eba76e79474fb36bb5125708ebdabd7f45c8eaf16caaabde9dd): Bind for 0.0.0.0:3000 failed: port is already allocated.
```

So, what happened? We aren't able to start the new container because our old container is still
running. The reason this is a problem is because that container is using the host's port 3000 and
only one process (containers included) can listen to a specific port. To fix this, we need to remove
the old container.


## Replacing our Old Container

To remove a container, it first needs to be stopped. Then, it can be removed.

1. Get the ID of the container by using the `docker ps` command.

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

1. Use the `docker stop` command to stop the container.

    ```bash
    # Swap out <the-container-id> with the ID from docker ps
    docker stop <the-container-id>
    ```

1. Once the container has stopped, you can remove it by using the `docker rm` command.

    ```bash
    docker rm <the-container-id>
    ```

1. Now, start your updated app.

    ```bash
    docker run -dp 3000:3000 docker-101
    ```

1. Open the app and you should see your updated help text!

![Updated application with updated empty text](todo-list-updated-empty-text.png){: style="width:55%" }
{: .text-center }

!!! info "Pro tip"
    You can stop and remove a container in a single command by adding the "force" flag
    to the `docker rm` command. For example: `docker rm -f <the-container-id>`


## Recap

While we were able to build an update, there were two things you might have noticed:

- All of the existing items in our todo list are gone! That's not a very good app! We'll talk about that
shortly.
- There were _a lot_ of steps involved for such a small change. In an upcoming section, we'll talk about 
how to see code updates without needing to rebuild and start a new container every time we make a change.

Before talking about persistence, we'll quickly see how to share these images with others.
